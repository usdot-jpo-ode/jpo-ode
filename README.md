# jpo-ode

**US Department of Transportation (USDOT) Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) Joint Program Office (JPO) Operational Data Environment (ODE)**

The ITS ODE is a real-time virtual data router that ingests and processes operational data from various connected devices - including vehicles, infrastructure, and traffic management centers - and distributes it to other devices and subscribing transportation management applications. Using the ITS ODE within intelligent transportation deployments increases data fluidity and interoperability while meeting operational needs and protecting user privacy. The software’s microservices architecture makes it easy to add new capabilities to meet local needs. Check the ITS factsheet for more information: <https://www.its.dot.gov/factsheets/pdf/ITSJPO_ODE.pdf>.

 -->

<a name="usgage-example"/>

## 1. Usage Example

Once the ODE is deployed and running locally, you may access the ODE's demonstration console by opening your browser and navigating to  `http://localhost:8080`.

1.  Press the `Connect` button to connect to the ODE WebSocket service.
2.  Press `Select File` button to select an OBU log file containing BSMs and/or TIM messages as specified by the WYDOT CV Pilot project. See below documents for details:
    - [Wyoming CV Pilot Log File Design](data/Wyoming_CV_Pilot_Log_File_Design.docx)
    - [WYDOT Log Records](data/wydotLogRecords.h)
3.  Press `Upload` button to upload the file to ODE.

Upload records within the files must be embedding BSM and/or TIM messages wrapped in J2735 MessageFrame and ASN.1 UPER encoded, wrapped in IEEE 1609.2 envelope and ASN.1 COER encoded binary format. Please review the files in the [data](data) folder for samples of each supported type. By uploading a valid data file, you will be able to observe the decoded messages contained within the file appear in the web UI page while connected to the WebSocket interface.

Another way data can be uploaded to the ODE is through copying the file to the location specified by the `ode.uploadLocationRoot/ode.uploadLocationObuLog`property. If not specified,  Default locations would be `uploads/bsmlog`sub-directory off of the location where ODE is launched.

The result of uploading and decoding of messages will be displayed on the UI screen.

![ODE UI](docs/images/readme/figure2.png)

_Figure 2: ODE UI demonstrating message subscription_

Notice that the empty fields in the J2735 message are represented by a `null` value. Also note that ODE output strips the MessageFrame header and returns a pure BSM or TIM in the subscription topic.


With the PPM module running, all filtered BSMs that are uploaded through the web interface will be captured and processed. You will see an output of both submitted BSM and processed data unless the entire record was filtered out.

############# Configuration #############
#########################################
 -->

<a name="configuration"/>

## 2. Configuration

### System Requirements

-  Minimum RAM: 16 GB
-  Minimum storage space: 100 GB
-  Supported operating systems:
   -  Ubuntu 18.04 Linux (Recommended)
   -  Windows 10 Professional (Professional version required for Docker virtualization)
   -  OSX 10 Mojave

The ODE software can run on most standard Window, Mac, or Linux based computers with
Pentium core processors. Performance of the software will be based on the computing power and available RAM in
the system.  Larger data flows can require much larger space requirements depending on the
amount of data being processed by the software. The ODE software application was developed using the open source programming language Java. If running the ODE outside of Docker, the application requires the Java 8 runtime environment.

### Software Prerequisites

The ODE is bundled as a series of submodules running in Docker containers and managed by Docker-Compose. All other required dependencies will automatically be downloaded and installed as part of the Docker build process.

- Docker: <https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/>
- Docker-Compose: <https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/>

### Tips and Advice

Read the following guides to familiarize yourself with ODE's Docker and Kafka modules.

- [Docker README](docker.md)
- [Kafka README](kafka.md)

**Installation and Deployment:**

- Docker builds may fail if you are on a corporate network due to DNS resolution errors.
[See here](https://github.com/usdot-jpo-ode/jpo-ode/wiki/Docker-fix-for-SSL-issues-due-to-corporate-network) for instructions to fix this.
- Additionally `git` commands may fail for similar reasons, you can fix this by running `export GIT_SSL_NO_VERIFY=1`.
- Windows users may find more information on installing and using Docker [here](https://github.com/usdot-jpo-ode/jpo-ode/wiki/Docker-management).
- Users interested in Kafka may find more guidance and configuration options [here](docker/kafka/README.md).

**Configuration:**

If you wish to change the application properties, such as change the location of the upload service via `ode.uploadLocation.*` properties or set the `ode.kafkaBrokers` to something other than the `$DOCKER_HOST_IP:9092`, or wish to change the log file upload folder, etc. instead of setting the environment variables, modify `jpo-ode-svcs\src\main\resources\application.properties` file as desired.

ODE configuration can be customized for every deployment environment using environment variables. These variables can either be set locally or using the [sample.env](sample.env) file. Instructions for how to use this file can be found [here](https://github.com/usdot-jpo-ode/jpo-ode/wiki/Using-the-.env-configuration-file).

**Important!**
You must rename `sample.env` to `.env` for Docker to automatically read the file. This file will contain AWS access keys and other private information. Do not push this file to source control.

########################################
############# Installation #############
########################################
 -->

<a name="installation"/>

## 3. Installation

The following instructions describe the minimal procedure to fetch, build, and run the main ODE application. If you want to use the privacy protection module and/or S3 depositors, see the [User Guide](docs/UserGuide.md) for more detailed information. Additionally, different build processes are covered at the bottom of this section.

#### Step 0 - For Windows Users Only

If running on Windows, please make sure that your global git config is set up to not convert end-of-line characters during checkout.

Disable `git core.autocrlf` (One Time Only)

```bash
git config --global core.autocrlf false
```

#### Step 1 - Download the Source Code

The ODE software system consists of the following modules hosted in separate Github repositories:

|Name|Visibility|Description|
|----|----------|-----------|
|[jpo-ode](https://github.com/usdot-jpo-ode/jpo-ode)|public|Contains the public components of the application code.|
|[jpo-cvdp](https://github.com/usdot-jpo-ode/jpo-cvdp)|public|Privacy Protection Module|
|[jpo-s3-deposit](https://github.com/usdot-jpo-ode/jpo-s3-deposit)|public|S3 depositor service. Optional, comment out of `docker-compose.yml` file if not used.|
|[asn1_codec](https://github.com/usdot-jpo-ode/asn1_codec)|public|ASN.1 Encoder/Decoder module|
|[jpo-security-svcs](https://github.com/usdot-jpo-ode/jpo-security-svcs)|public|Provides cryptographic services.|
|[jpo-sdw-depositor](https://github.com/usdot-jpo-ode/jpo-sdw-depositor)|public|SDW depositor service. Optional, comment out of `docker-compose.yml` file if not used.|

You may download the stable, default branch for ALL of these dependencies by using the following recursive git clone command:

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/usdot-jpo-ode/jpo-ode.git
```

Once you have these repositories obtained, you are ready to build and deploy the application.

##### Downloading the source code from a non-default branch

<details><summary>(Advanced) Downloading the source code from a non-default branch</summary>
<p>

The above steps to pull the code from GitHub repository pulls it from the default branch which is the stable branch. If you wish to pull the source code from a branch that is still under development or beta testing, you will need to specify the branch to pull from. The following commands aid you in that action.

**Note**: These commands can also be performed using the provided script `update_branch`.

```bash
# Backup user provided source or configuration files used by submodules
cp asn1_codec/asn1c_combined/J2735_201603DA.ASN .

# Run the following commands to reset existing branch
git reset --hard
git submodule foreach --recursive git reset --hard

# Pull from the non-default branch
git checkout <branch_name>
git pull origin <branch_name>

# The next command wipes out all of the submodules and re-initializes them.
git submodule deinit -f . && git submodule update --recursive --init

# Restore user provided source or configuration files used by submodules
cp ./J2735_201603DA.ASN asn1_codec/asn1c_combined/
```

</p>
</details>

#### Step 2 - Build and run the application

**Notes:**
- Docker builds may fail if you are on a corporate network due to DNS resolution errors.
[See here](https://github.com/usdot-jpo-ode/jpo-ode/wiki/Docker-fix-for-SSL-issues-due-to-corporate-network) for instructions to fix this.
- In order for Docker to automatically read the environment variable file, you must rename it from `sample.env` to `.env`. **This file will contain private keys, do not put add it to version control.**

Copy the following files from `jpo-ode` directory into your DOCKER_SHARED_VOLUME directory.
- Copy jpo-ode/ppm.properties to ${DOCKER_SHARED_VOLUME}/config.properties. Open the newly copied `config.properties` file in a text editor and update the `metadata.broker.list=your.docker.host.ip:9092` line with your system's DOCKER_HOST_IP in place of the dummy `your.docker.host.ip` string.
- Copy jpo-ode/adm.properties to ${DOCKER_SHARED_VOLUME}/adm.properties
- Copy jpo-ode/aem.properties to ${DOCKER_SHARED_VOLUME}/aem.properties

Navigate to the root directory of the jpo-ode project and run the following command:

```bash
docker-compose up --build -d
docker-compose ps
```

To bring down the services and remove the running containers run the following command:

```bash
docker-compose down
```
For a fresh restart, run:

```bash
docker-compose down
docker-compose up --build -d
docker-compose ps
```

To completely rebuild from scratch, run:

```bash
docker-compose down
docker-compose rm -fvs
docker-compose up --build -d
docker-compose ps
```

Check the deployment by running `docker-compose ps`. You can start and stop containers using `docker-compose start` and `docker-compose stop` commands.
If using the multi-broker docker-compose file, you can change the scaling by running `docker-compose scale <container>=n` where container is the container you would like to scale and n is the number of instances. For example, `docker-compose scale kafka=3`.


#### asn1_codec Module (ASN.1 Encoder and Decoder)
ODE requires the deployment of asn1_codec module. ODE's `docker-compose.yml` file is set up to build and deploy the module in a Docker container. If you wish to run `asn1_codec` module outside Docker (i.e. directly on the host machine), please refer to the documentation of `asn1_codec` module.

The only requirement for deploying `asn1_codec` module on Docker is the setup of two environment variables `DOCKER_HOST_IP` and `DOCKER_SHARED_VOLUME`.

#### PPM Module (Geofencing and Filtering)

To run the ODE with PPM module, you must install and start the PPM service. PPM service communicates with other services through Kafka Topics. PPM will read from the specified "Raw BSM" topic and publish the result to the specified "Filtered Bsm" topic. These topic names are specified by the following ODE and PPM properties:

 - ODE properties for communications with PPM (set in application.properties)
	 - ode.kafkaTopicOdeBsmJson  (default = topic.OdeBsmJson)
	 - ode.kafkaTopicFilteredOdeBsmJson (default = topic.FilteredOdeBsmJson)
 - PPM properties for communications with ODE (set in yourconfig.properties)
	 - privacy.topic.consumer (default = j2735BsmRawJson)
	 - privacy.topic.producer (default = j2735BsmFilteredJson)

Follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/usdot-jpo-ode/jpo-cvdp/blob/master/docs/installation.md) to install and build the PPM service.

During the build process, edit the sample config file located in `config/example.properties` and point the property `metadata.broker.list` towards the host of your docker machine or wherever the kafka brokers are hosted. You may use the command `docker-machine ls` to find the kafka service.

After a successful build, use the following commands to configure and run the PPM

```
cd $BASE_PPM_DIR/jpo-cvdp/build
$ ./bsmjson_privacy -c ../config/ppm.properties
```

# Confluent Cloud Integration

Rather than using a local kafka instance, the ODE can utilize an instance of kafka hosted by Confluent Cloud via SASL.



## Environment variables

### Purpose & Usage

- The DOCKER_HOST_IP environment variable is used to communicate with the bootstrap server that the instance of Kafka is running on.

- The KAFKA_TYPE environment variable specifies what type of kafka connection will be attempted and is used to check if Confluent should be utilized. If this environment variable is not set, the ODE will default to normal behavior.

- The CONFLUENT_KEY and CONFLUENT_SECRET environment variables are used to authenticate with the bootstrap server. If the KAFKA_TYPE environment variable is not set, then these are not required.



### Values
In order to utilize Confluent Cloud:

- DOCKER_HOST_IP must be set to the bootstrap server address (excluding the port)

- KAFKA_TYPE must be set to "CONFLUENT"

- CONFLUENT_KEY must be set to the API key being utilized for CC

- CONFLUENT_SECRET must be set to the API secret being utilized for CC



## CC Docker Compose File

There is a provided docker-compose file (docker-compose-confluent-cloud.yml) that passes the above environment variables into the container that gets created. Further, this file doesn't spin up a local kafka instance since it is not required.



## Note

This has only been tested with Confluent Cloud but technically all SASL authenticated Kafka brokers can be reached using this method.

### Quality Assurance

Code quality assurance is reported through the [usdot-jpo-ode SonarCloud organization](https://sonarcloud.io/organizations/usdot-jpo-ode/projects). Code quality reports are generated by the [JaCoCo plugin for Maven](https://www.eclemma.org/jacoco/trunk/doc/maven.html) during the ODE's [webhook-triggered TravisCI build](https://github.com/usdot-jpo-ode/jpo-ode/blob/dev/.travis.yml#L16). After a successful build, the [SonarQube scanner plugin for Maven](https://docs.sonarqube.org/display/SCAN/Analyzing+with+SonarQube+Scanner+for+Maven) creates and uploads a code quality report to SonarCloud.

For regression and user acceptance testing, ODE provides an automated test harness. The test harness is pprovided in the [qa/test-harness](ga/test-harness) directory under jpo-ode root folder. The test harness uses the ODE [Validator Library](https://github.com/usdot-jpo-ode/ode-output-validator-library) repository as a submodule.

For more information, please see: https://github.com/usdot-jpo-ode/jpo-ode/wiki/Using-the-ODE-test-harness

## 9. Known Bugs

Date: 07/2017

In its current state, the ODE has been developed to accomplish the goals of data transfer, security, and modularity working with the J2735 and 1609.2 security. The system has been designed to support multiple services orchestrated through the Apache Kafka streaming data pipelines, services built and supported as separate applications and described with each service's repository. As a modular system, each component has been built for functionality first, and additional performance testing is needed to understand the limits of the system with large volumes of data.

### Troubleshooting

Please read our [Wiki](https://github.com/usdot-jpo-ode/jpo-ode/wiki) for more information, or check the [User Guide](docs/UserGuide.md).

Application Support for the ODE currently managed via GitHub's native issue tracker: <https://github.com/usdot-jpo-ode/jpo-ode/issues>.
