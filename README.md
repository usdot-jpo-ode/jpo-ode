### Continuous Integration and Delivery
https://travis-ci.org/usdot-jpo-ode/jpo-ode

To allow Travis run your build when you push your changes to your public fork of the jpo-ode repository, you must define the following secure environment variable using Travis CLI (https://github.com/travis-ci/travis.rb).

Run:

```
travis login --org
```
Enter personal github account credentials and then run this:

```
travis env set PRIVATE_REPO_URL_UN_PW 'https://<bitbucketusername>:<password>@bitbucket.org/usdot-jpo-ode/jpo-ode-private.git' -r <travis username>/jpo-ode
```

The login information will be saved and this needs to be done only once.

In order to allow Sonar to run, personal key must be added with this command:
(Key can be obtained from the JPO-ODE development team)

```
travis env set SONAR_SECURITY_TOKEN <key> -pr <user-account>/<repo-name>
```

## IV. Getting Started

The following instructions describe the procedure to fetch, build, and run the application. 

### Prerequisites
* JDK 1.8: http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/pt/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html
* Maven: https://maven.apache.org/install.html
* Git: https://git-scm.com/

Additionally, read the following guides to familiarize yourself with Docker and Kafka.

**Docker** 

[README.md](docker/README.md)

**Kafka** 

[README.md](docker/kafka/README.md)

---
### Obtain the Source Code

**NOTE**: The ODE consists of two repositories: a public repository containing the bulk of the application code, and a private repository containing the ASN.1-compiled dependencies. Building this application requires BOTH of these repositories. If you need access to the private repository, please reach out to a member of the development team.

#### Step 1 - Clone public repository

Disable Git core.autocrlf (Only the First Time)
**NOTE**: If running on Windows, please make sure that your global git config is set up to not convert End-of-Line characters during checkout. This is important for building docker images correctly.

```bash
git config --global core.autocrlf false
```

Clone the source code from the GitHub repository using Git command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/usdot-jpo-ode/jpo-ode.git
```

#### Step 2 - Clone private repository

Clone the source code from the BitBucket repository:

```bash
git clone https://usdot-jpo-ode@bitbucket.org/usdot-jpo-ode/jpo-ode-private.git
```

---
### Build and Deploy the Application

The ODE application uses Maven to manage builds.

**Step 1**: Build the private repository artifacts. 

Navigate to the root directory of the jpo-ode-private project:

```bash
 cd jpo-ode-private/
 mvn clean
 mvn install
```
It is important you run `mvn clean` first and _then_ `mvn install` because clean installs the required OSS jar file in your local maven repository.

**(Optional)**: Familiarize yourself with Docker and follow the instructions in the [docker/README.me].

**(Optional)**: If you wish to change the application properties, such as change the location of the upload service via ode.uploadLocation property or set the ode.kafkaBrokers to something other than the $DOCKER_HOST_IP:9092, modify ```jpo-ode-svcs\src\main\resources\application.properties``` file as desired.

**Step 2**: Navigate to the root directory of the jpo-ode project.

**Step 3**: Build and deploy the application. 

The easiest way to do this is to run the ```clean-build-and-deploy``` script. 
This script executes the following commands:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
docker-compose stop
docker-compose rm -f -v
mvn clean install
docker-compose up --build -d
docker-compose ps
```

For other build options, see the next section. Otherwise, move on to section [V. Testing the Application](#testing)

### Other Build/Deploy Options

#### Building ODE without Deploying
To build the ODE docker container images but not deploy it, run the following commands:

```bash
 cd jpo-ode (or cd ../jpo-ode if you are in the jpo-ode-private directory)
 mvn clean install
 docker-compose rm -f -v
 docker-compose build
```

Alternatively, you may run the ```clean-build``` script.

#### Deploying ODE Application on a Docker Host
To deploy the the application on the docker host configured in your DOCKER_HOST_IP machine, run the following:

```bash
docker-compose up --no-recreate -d
```

**NOTE**: It's important to run ```docker-compose up``` with ```no-recreate``` option. Otherwise you may run into [this issue] (https://github.com/wurstmeister/kafka-docker/issues/100).

Alternatively, run ```deploy``` script.

Check the deployment by running ```docker-compose ps```. You can start and stop containers using ```docker-compose start``` and ```docker-compose stop``` commands.
If using the multi-broker docker-compose file, you can change the scaling by running ```docker-compose scale <container>=n``` where container is the container you would like to scale and n is the number of instances. For example, ```docker-compose scale kafka=3```.

#### Running ODE Application on localhost
You can run the application on your local machine while other services are deployed on a host environment. To do so, run the following:
```bash
 docker-compose start zookeeper kafka
 java -jar jpo-ode-svcs/target/jpo-ode-svcs-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

## V. Testing ODE Application
Once the ODE is running, you should be able to access the jpo-ode web UI at `localhost:8080`.

1. Press the ```Connect``` button to connect to the ODE WebSocket service.
2. Press ```Choose File``` button to select a file with J2735 BSM or MessageFrame records in ASN.1 UPER encoding
3. Press ```Upload``` button to upload the file to ODE.

Upload a file containing BSM messages or J2735 MessageFrame in ASN.1 UPER encoded binary format. For example, try the file [data/bsm.uper](data/bsm.uper) or [data/messageFrame.uper](data/messageFrame.uper) and observe the decoded messages returned to the web UI page while connected tot he WebSocket interface.

Alternatively, you may upload a file containing BSM messages in ASN.1 UPER encoded hexadecimal format. For example, a file containing the following pure BSM record and a file extension of ```.hex``` or  ```.txt``` would be processed and decoded by the ODE and results returned to the web UI page:
```text
401480CA4000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000F800D9EFFFB7FFF00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001FE07000000000000000000000000000000000001FF0
```
*Note: Hexadecimal file format is for test purposes only. ODE is not expected to receive ASN.1 data records in hexadecimal format from the field devices.*

Another way data can be uploaded to the ODE is through copying the file to the location specified by the ```ode.uploadLocationRoot/ode.uploadLocationBsm``` or ```ode.uploadLocationRoot/ode.uploadLocationMessageFrame``` property. If not specified,  Default locations would be ```uploads/bsm``` and ```uploads/messageframe``` sub-directories off of the location where ODE is launched.

The result of uploading and decoding of the message will be displayed on the UI screen.

![ODE UI](images/ode-ui.png)

*Notice that the empty fields in the J2735 message are represented by a ```null``` value. Also note that ODE output strips the MessageFrame header and returns a pure BSM in the J2735 BSM subscription topic.*

### PPM Module (Geofencing and Filtering)

To run the ODE with additional modules requires installing and starting the service. Since all of the services communicate through published Kafka Topics, the PPM will read from the Raw BSM topic and publish the result to the FilteredBsm Topic.

Please follows the instructions located here to install and build the application. [Installation Guide](https://github.com/usdot-jpo-ode/jpo-cvdp/blob/master/docs/installation.md)

During the building, please edit the Kafka configuration located here in `src/kafka_consumer.cpp` on line 216 and point it towards the host of your docker machine. You may use the command `docker-machine ls` to find the machine up where the kafka topics reside.

```    
std::string brokers = "192.168.99.100";
```

After building, use the following commands to configure and run the PPM

```
cd $BASE_PPM_DIR/jpo-cvdp/build
$ ./bsmjson_privacy -c ../config/<testconfig>.properties
```
With the PPM module running, all filtered BSMs that are uploaded through the web interface will be captured and processed. You will see an output of both submitted BSM and processed data unless the entire record was filtered out.
