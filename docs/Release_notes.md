----------------------------

Version 1.3.0, released Mar 30th 2023
----------------------------------------

### **Summary**
The updates for jpo-ode 1.3.0 release includes enhancements such as support for Confluent Cloud, better debugging with the C++ submodules, new JSON output schemas, and improvements for all J2735 message type ser/des. Along with the enhancements below, several bug fixes and CI related enhancements are included in this release.

Enhancements in this release:
-	Issue 466: Removes duplicated J2735 payload data due to Jackson serialization default behavior. Adds annotations to payload classes. Resolves BSM coreData support issues.
-	Issue 468: Resolves TIM ingestion issues created by the previous removal of the gson libraries.

-	PR 478: Bumps kafka-clients from 0.10.1.0 to 0.10.2.2
	PR 482: Adds VSCode support for debugging C++ submodules within the jpo-ode project.
-	Issue 485: Updates the jpo-ode SPaT output to better support the J2735 established enum values.
-	Issue 491: Updates schemas to reflect current message output structure of the jpo-ode message types. Removes null values from jpo-ode output messages.
-	Issue 493: Fixes SRM bug for properly deserializing multiple requests in a single SRM message and handling zero requests.
-	PR 494: Bumps logback-core from 1.2.8 to 1.2.9
-	PR 497: Updates base image to eclipse-temurin:11-jre-alpine rather than the deprecated openjdk:8-jre-alpine.
-	PR 498: Adds the GitHub actions workflows for both docker hub build and to run sonar scan analysis for publishing static reports on sonar cloud dashboard.
-	PR 500: Modifies TimDepositController class to allow unknown properties when converting a JSON object to a POJO, resolving an issue where TIMs with additional RSU properties were causing process failures.

Known Issues:
-	One of the tests for the TimDepositController class is failing due to invalid test input. Specifically, the test expects malformed json but is currently being given valid json.
-	The lane type in map messages isn’t handled correctly at this time.

Version 1.2.0., released Oct 30th, 2020
----------------------------------------

### **Summary**
This update for the ODE includes the ability to support the ISS HSM sigValidityOverride parameter to change the default TIM SCMS signature expiration time from the default 4 hours to a programmed time that matches the TIM MAP expiration. This update also provides feedback for the signature expiration (as it could be less than the requested time due to the HSM certificate expiration time). See issue 370 for details. This should also work for MAP messages, but was not tested.
This update also incorporates a fix to support for relative positions for TIM messages. See issue 372 for details.
