# Submodule Compatibility Guide
This table serves as a guide, suggesting which versions of individual submodules are best suited to accompany each version of the main module. It helps users ensure compatibility and smooth integration by recommending specific submodule versions for their chosen main module version.

| 3.0.0 | 2.2.0 | 1.4.0 | 1.5.0 | 1.8.0 | 1.6.0 | 1.4.2 | 1.4.2 | 1.4.1 | 1.4.0 |
| 2.1.0 | 2.1.0 | 1.3.0 | 1.4.0 | 1.7.0 | 1.5.0 | 1.3.0 | 1.3.0 | 1.3.0 | 1.3.0 |
| 2.0.x | 2.0.0 | 1.3.0 | 1.4.0 | 1.6.0 | 1.4.0 | 1.2.0 | 1.2.0 | 1.2.0 | 1.2.0 |
| 1.5.1 | 1.5.0 | 1.2.0 | 1.3.0 | 1.5.0 | 1.3.0 | 1.1.0 | 1.1.0 | 1.1.0 | 1.1.0 |
| 1.4.1 | 1.4.1 | 1.1.1 | 1.2.1 | 1.4.1 | 1.2.1 | 1.0.0 | 1.0.1 | 1.0.1 | 1.0.1 |
| 1.4.0 | 1.4.0 | 1.1.0 | 1.2.0 | 1.4.0 | 1.2.0 | N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A |
| 1.3.0 | 1.3.0 | 1.0.0 | 1.0.1 | 1.3.0 | 1.1.0 | N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A |

For example, if you're using ODE version 2.0.1, it's recommended to use ACM 2.0.0, PPM 1.3.0, SEC 1.4.0, SDWD 1.6.0, S3D 1.4.0, GJConverter 1.2.0, CMonitor 1.2.0, CVisualizer 1.2.0, and CVManager 1.2.0. While other combinations may work, these versions are suggested for the best compatibility.
